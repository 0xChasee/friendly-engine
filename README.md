friendly-engine - It's a keylogger.

Friendly-engine works via a Python script which logs all of your keystrokes. Ooh, I'm getting keylogged now.
It operates as an invisible window which logs all of your keystrokes into a specific .txt file located in the keylogger's main folder.

# It's open-source and free to use, but a warning still exists.
Use it only for ethical purposes. I am not developing repositories just for it to be used for illegal purposes. Don't be a dick.

# WIP
It's work in progress, as we are still creating it.
