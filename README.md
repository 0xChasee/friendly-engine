friendly-engine - It's a keylogger.

Friendly-engine works via a Python script which logs all of your keystrokes. Ooh, I'm getting keylogged now.
It operates as an invisible window which logs all of your keystrokes into a specific .txt file.

# It's open-source and free to use, but a warning still exists.
Use it only for ethical purposes. I am not developing repositories just for it to be used for illegal purposes. Don't be a dick.

# How to use it?
To run this:
- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
~~- You need a GMAIL account to get the reports - WARNING: You must have Less secure app access on and 2fA off - [Less secure apps]~~
You no longer need a GMAIL account to get the reports, but might be insecure.
